#Creating a scoreboard setting----
#1. Make sure you have a scoreboard ready in TAB's config.yml, under 'scoreboards:'. This will be the
#   scoreboard that will be displayed (if action is SHOW)
#2. Head over to the plugin directory in the plugins folder, then into the 'Settings Directory' (/home/container/plugins/cScoreboards/Settings)
#3. Create a new file, and set the type to 'YAML' (bottom right)
#4. Copy and Paste the example config (ABOVE)
#5. Edit to your needs (Use my comments for help)
#6. Click Save
#7. Restart OR run /csb reload in game or through console
#8. You're done!
